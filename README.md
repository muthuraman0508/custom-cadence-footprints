# custom-cadence-footprints
Custom PCB footprints designed using Cadence OrCAD/Allegro. This repository contains footprints for ICs, connectors, and other electronic components, organized for easy integration into PCB designs.


# Muthu's Cadence Footprints

This repository is a collection of **custom PCB footprints** designed using **Cadence OrCAD/Allegro** tools. I plan to design and upload **at least one footprint (dimension) per day**, focused on accuracy and reuse in professional PCB designs.
